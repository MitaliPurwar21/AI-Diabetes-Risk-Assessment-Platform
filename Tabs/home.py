    * **Robust Model Training:** This app isn't built on a small, standard dataset. It's powered by a model trained on a **100,000-row synthetic dataset** to ensure more stable and generalizable performance.
    
    * **Automated Model Selection:** The prediction model wasn't just *chosen*â€”it *competed*. The training script compares **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**, automatically selecting the best-performing model (based on ROC AUC) to serve in this app.
    
    * **Explainable AI (XAI):** This tool doesn't just give a prediction; it explains *why*. Using **SHAP plots** on the 'Diagnosis' page, you can see exactly how each factor (like Glucose or BMI) contributed to the final risk score.
